## How to use

This library is still under development and private mode, so you need a token to test it in your project (generated by @artemshar).

Get it and put in ```~/.npmrc``` file (**make sure that the token not in repo!**):

```
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
@artemshar:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Then install the library
```npm install @artemshar/mulib``` 
```yarn add @artemshar/mulib```

And use components

```import { Button } from "@artemshar/mulib"```
